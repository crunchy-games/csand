REPORTING A SECURITY VULNERABILITY

* What classifies as a security vulnerability? *
Memory leaks, memory errors, and other exploitable
bugs are considered security vulnerabilities (which
from now on will be called 'security leaks').

* Common security leaks *
- Exploits in the game's code
- Injection
- Memory leaks
- Segmentation faults
- Memory corruption

* Where should I contact someone when finding a security leak? *
_DO NOT_ make a public bug report about it. Email stupidlilgoober@gmail.com
or DM me on Discord (@stupidlilgoober).

Making a public report might give malicious users the tools
they need to exploit the problem.
